*Provide three examples from Geoff Westâ€™s reading that illustrate how scale can be used to more fully understand human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system.  Additionally, what did Geoff West have to say about the use of theory and big data?  According to West, can a theory be relevant in the face of big data? Please provide an example.*

One example that Geoff West uses in his book to explain how scale can be used to develop a better understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system is the intricate workings of cities. West explains that even though cities are different historically, geographically, and culturally, they are merely scaled versions of each other. He describes the sublinear scaling within cities by discussing how infrastructure increases 0.85 times relative to population whereas more socioeconomic factors change by 1.15 times. Another example West uses in his book to explain scale is social networks. He explains how greater city size leads to more social interactions per capita, which affects both socioeconomic properties as well as infrastructural necessities. He also explains how interacting with people affects levels of intimacy, resulting in consistent scaling overall. West also uses companies as to elaborate on how scale influences our understanding of human development. He states that companies also scale by simple power laws. Unlike socioeconomic quantities in cities where superlinear scaling is present, companies utilize sublinear scaling. However, there is more variation within the scaling of companies than in cities.

Geoff West says that big data can be used to refine predictions, theories, and models, but individuals should not be mistaking these conclusions to be certain. Big data and theories play a key role in developing a better understanding of human development and in several industries. For example, to study poverty in various locations, satellites can be used to collect data for analysis. West emphasizes the fact that big data and theories are based of patterns and correlation rather than causation, and that individuals need to remember that in creating theories and in understanding data.
