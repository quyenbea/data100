# Wicked Problems

## Introduction

Hello! My name is Quyen Tran and I'm currently a freshman at William & Mary. I'm planning on majoring in chemistry on the premed track with a minor in public health!
I'm from Springfield, Virginia and have lived here my whole life. I love to travel, bake, and binge Netflix.
