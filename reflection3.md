*How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen’s definition to include the idea of complexity?*

Amartya Sen defines development as broadening individuals' choices and freedoms in order to ameliorate one’s well-being. However, Owen Barder argues that development isn’t just the sum of the improvements that occur in people’s lives. Development shouldn’t only be seen as the overall change in an individual’s life in achieving success. Instead, he believes that development should be viewed as an attribute of the economic and social systems. It is important to take all aspects of development into account in order to fully grasp the big picture.

*What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?*

Thomas Thwaites attempted to create an electric toaster from scratch in what is known as the toaster project. After purchasing a cheap, simple toaster and examining its 400 parts of varying materials, he attempted to recreate its parts using raw materials. After nine months and lots of challenges, he was only able to use his toaster for five seconds before it burned down. This example demonstrates how development is not only the sum of improvements in life, but instead can be seen as a gradual process of increased productivity. The toaster project illustrates how economic and social systems affect development in varying factors depending on the technologies, firms, and products as well as economic, legal, financial, social, and political systems working together.

*According to Barder how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?*

Barder claims that economists have not been viewing economic development as the properties of different systems working together to provide individuals with the ability to live fulfilling lives over the last few decades. Rather, they have been considering development as the sum of changes in individuals and firms, viewing economic growth as equal to economic development. He explains that one model, the Harrod-Domar model, was used by saying that output can increase with more capital or more labor. Another model, the Rostow model, used different stages in the process of economic growth to explain economic success. However, some of these models are not accurate in real life and cannot be used to explain why some countries flourish while others do not. Barder elaborates on the fact that these models do not take into account particular factors that have great influence on the productivity within these different countries.

*Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at uni-lever? Was he successful? How significant were his results?*

Steve Jones is a well-known evolutionary biologist who was given the task to develop an improved nozzle to use in the process of making soap powder at Unilever. In order to do this, Jones randomly changed 10 copies of the original nozzle in order to measure which worked best. He would then take the most efficient nozzle, adapt that one 10 different ways, and measured each to find the best one of that batch. He continued this process with each batch of 10 several times until he found the best version that ended up being hundreds of times better than the original nozzle. His results demonstrate that adaptive change can bring about significant improvements, not just small tweaks. 

*What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?*

A complex adaptive system is a system that’s nonlinear and, as stated in the name, complex. The economy is an example of a complex adaptive system and Barder argues that economists often forget that they’re trying to model this nonlinear system with simplified models. Barder discusses five important features of these systems. First, it is incredibly challenging and even impossible in some cases to accurately predict because of the butterfly effect, or the idea that one change in a nonlinear system can serve as the beginning of a long chain of events resulting in an unrelated outcome. Second, these systems make generalized predictions of systems since details are unpredictable. Third, complex adaptive systems are characterized by emergent properties. Fourth, these systems often shift towards more complexity. This is different from the majority of economic models which tend to gravitate to simple conclusions. Lastly, these systems don’t usually shift towards an equilibrium, meaning that patterns can be stable for a long time, but can witness unexpected, large shifts once in awhile.

*Who was Haile Sellasie?  According to Barder (and Kapuscinski), how did Ethiopia during the time of The Emperor exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change?*

Haile Sellasie was the last emperor during Ethiopia’s feudal dynasty. Selassie ruled so strictly that people felt as if it was unsafe to inform him of the issues prevalent in the countryside. During this time, Ethiopia exemplified the suppression of emergent systemic change by reducing the population’s economic value. The elites maintained their power and did not focus on the evolution of the economic or political systems, demonstrating how the emergence of system change was contained.

*Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication? What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?*

Barder recommends resisting engineering as a policy implication because it is challenging to develop solutions involving a complex adaptive system. One reason for this is that evolutionary improvements usually outperform design. In addition, due to the fact that this is a nonlinear system, it is very difficult to predict the outcomes of any shift. Isomorphic mimicry is an idea part of evolutionary theory. This idea can be seen when the appearance of animals change into looking more dangerous than they actually are, serving as a protective behavior. In terms of development, Barder emphasizes the idea that it is important to create actual functional organizations rather than institutions that simply mimic the look of a successful organization. 

*What does Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?*

By “resisting fatalism”, Barder is trying to say that evolutionary outcomes do not have to be accepted. Rather, it is necessary to take matters into our own hands and alter the evolutionary processes. Borlaug was able to crossbreed disease resistant wheat and as a result, saved billions of people. By taking matters into his own hands, he was able to change the result of the evolutionary processes. Barder uses this example to support the idea that by altering processes ourselves, we can intervene in a beneficial way rather than merely accepting what is to come.
