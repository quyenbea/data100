*“Revolutions in science have often been preceded by revolutions in measurement.”
Sinan Aral (cited in Kitchen, 2014)*

*In “Big Data, New Epistemologies and Paradigm Shifts” by Rob Kitchen the author emphasizes the importance of measurement as a significant contributing factor for improved description and analysis of complex natural and/or social phenomenon. How is the advent of big data serving to advance this revolution in measurement and subsequently, how is this revolution in measurement serving to elevate data science as an interdisciplinary field of study? How is the data deluge advancing a better understanding of human movement, behavior and relationships? How does data science contribute towards our improved understanding of human development as a complex and adapting social and economic system?*

Big Data plays a major role in continuing the measurement revolution. In his article, Kitchen explains that Big Data is characterized by a vast volume and is diverse, exhaustive, fine-grained, and even flexible. The scale that Big Data covers has changed how data can be analyzed and has created more opportunities for advancements in data science as complex techniques and modifications to data analysis arise in various industries. This revolution paves the way for great improvements in the field of data science quantitatively as well as qualitatively. From tracking bank transactions to recording email interactions to updating satellite images, big data has allowed for advancements of knowledge and in data science that individuals didn’t even know were capable a decade ago. 

The advent of Big Data and the revolution of measurement influences all fields of study and is not only limited to the STEM fields. With statistical analyses and carefully curated algorithms, this change in how we view data has allowed for diverse applications in the real world. For example, the analysis of numbers encompassing statistics in the pandemic has generated a better understanding for researchers to fully grasp where and how fast a pathogen is spreading, giving them the ability to produce a model plan to combat the situation. Big Data can be seen as a useful tool in answering general questions in many different fields, especially when studying patterns among the human population.

Data science contributes toward our better understanding of human development by not only being able to deduce patterns, but also by allowing researchers to make sophisticated conclusions based on extreme amounts of evidence. Data science can be useful in proposing models to ameliorate social and economic issues by using the information collected over time. By incorporating the use of both quantitative and qualitative analysis, this field of study has a very broad scope as to what can be uncovered in terms of human development and can overall have a large influence on how systems and industries act.
