For this project, I estimated spatial values across Slovenia and plotted the predicted populations of different regions.

These first four plots depict predicted spatial values of the two most populated cities in Slovenia at the first and second administrative divisions.

1. This plot depicts the population of the Osrednjeslovensk region at the first administrative level.

2. This plot depicts the population of Ljubljana, Slovenia's capital city located in the Osrednjeslovensk region, at the second administrative level.
